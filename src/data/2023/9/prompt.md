## Is Santa Dyslexic?

_\[it's early Saturday morning and the team has been working overtime. Santa storms into the factory floor shouting..\]_

> _\[Santa\]_ Don't you elves take any pride in your work?!?! Others would love to have your job for much less pay! I asked for a simple type that will reverse strings!! How hard is that?!? What do we even pay you for??

_\[unfortunately, Santa is conveniently forgetting that the `Reverse` type was cut from the sprint (which... of course... he agreed to)\]_

> _\[floor manager\]_ Ok. We never got acceptance criteria for that ticket.
>
> _\[Santa\]_ How difficult is it to understand what Reverse does!? `'rehsaD'` should be transformed into `'Dasher'`, `'recnaD'` should be transformed into `'Dancer'`, `'recnarP'` should be transformed into `'Prancer'`.. DO I NEED TO KEEP GOING?

> _\[floor manager\]_ Well you might be surprised. For example, what should happen to multi-codepoint unicode characters?
>
> _\[Santa\]_ What are you on about with all that accessibility stuff again!
>
> _\[floor manager\]_ Accessibility is important, sir.
>
> _\[Santa\]_ Look, this is just an MVP. We can add accessibility later. Just get me my `Reverse` type! I'm having a hard time reading this stuff otherwise!
