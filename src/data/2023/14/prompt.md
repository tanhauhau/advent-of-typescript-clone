## Naughty List Decipher

_\[early on the morning of Thursday December 14th, Santa stumbles into office greeted by Bernard, the head elf..\]_

> _\[Bernard\]_ YOU'RE A MESS. Were you out partying.. on a WEDNESDAY?? AGAIN??!!!
>
> _\[Santa\]_ It seems as such. Some investors were in town so we went over to the Mistletoe Lounge and things got a little out of hand.
>
> _\[Bernard\]_ I oughta report you to HR. Seriously. This is getting out of control.
>
> _\[Santa\]_ We're like a family here; no need for formal HR processes!
>
> _\[Bernard\]_ Where's the list for today's naughty kids? We're behind on coal lump production.
>
> _\[Santa\]_ Umm.
>
> _\[Bernard\]_ You're joking. Tell me you're joking. You lost the list _again_?
>
> _\[Santa\]_ Well, not _lost_ per se.
>
> _\[Bernard\]_ Then where is it?
>
> _\[Santa\]_ I have it.. but I only scribbled down the names real quick with slashes in between them.

## Covering for Santa, again.

Looks like we're gonna need to pick up the slack for Santa yet again. He's got a list like `"melkey/prime/theo/trash"` and we need to turn it into a union of strings `"melkey" | "prime" | "theo" | "trash"`.
