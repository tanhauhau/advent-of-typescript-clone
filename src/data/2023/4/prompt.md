## Christmas Present Delivery Addresses

Clearly, Bernard is a bit disgruntled. Can you blame him? Alas, there's still more work to do. Bernard walks away and mutters to himself:

> _\[Bernard\]_ Guess it's time to drag myself through another pointless TypeScript type challenge with no practical application.

Poor Bernard. Let's help him out.

Today's task is to craft a type (`PresentDeliveryList`) that takes an object type as an input and then replaces the values at each property with an `Address`. We don't know in advance what properties will be provided, which is why it needs to be a generic type. Otherwise Bernard would probably just copy/pasta it to get through the day.
